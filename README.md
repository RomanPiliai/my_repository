<h2>Task 1: Software configuration</h2>
<h3>Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?</h2>
I decided to participate in Dare IT challenge because  I want to learn new skills in automated testing, I think this will be my introduction into programmers world. My main motivation is to find a better job and just start working in ITðŸ˜„ <br />
Also I expect to learn how to do automation of everyday tasks, basic knowledge of python and how to do tests and work in a group.
